# AI Papers, Explained & Rebuilt
AI research papers often feel intimidating — dense math, heavy notation, and complex implementations.
This repository is a personal learning initiative to **demystify influential AI papers** by explaining them clearly and rebuilding them step by step.

The goal is not to chase state-of-the-art results, but to **deeply understand why these ideas work**, how they are implemented, and where they succeed or fail in real-world systems.
